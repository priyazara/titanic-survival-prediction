# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This is a beginner-level machine learning project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle using logistic regression.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is from the [Kaggle Titanic Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).

> 🔗 *Please download the dataset from Kaggle directly. It is not included in this repository.*

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

## 🧠 Model

The model used in this project is **Logistic Regression**, a basic classification algorithm well-suited for binary outcomes (survived or not).
